This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Reproducible Research Course Project 1
### Required libraries
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(chron)
library(ggplot2)
```
## Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
```{r}
fulldata = read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",",na.strings = "NA")
fulldata = tbl_df(fulldata)
```
# Changing the date variable to appropriate format
```{r}
fulldata$date = ymd(fulldata$date)
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
